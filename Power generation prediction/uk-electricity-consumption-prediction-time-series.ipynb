ran the model, but as you can see, the code is commented out. The model took almost 25 minutes to run (the exact output of the original run is 0:24:27.022123), even though I set the maximum number of iterations to 25. I initially saved the entire model but it was a 10 GB file... Therefore, I decided to save the graphs only. \n\nDespite the runtime and the complexity of the model, it actually leads to a worse prediction since the mape value is 26.2 (the exact result is 26.17452577271045).\n\nThe reality is that none of the SARIMA models perform well. They don't capture the trend and the struggle to capture the yearly seasonality. Obviously, the parameters need to be refined, but the models take too long to run to choose the optimal parameters using [pdarima](https://pypi.org/project/pmdarima/) or a similar package.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='xgboost'></a>\n\n# XGboost\n\nThe second forecasting method I will use is XGBoost. It isn't a forecasting tool per se, but a regression tool. While traditional regression techniques struggle with time series forecasting, XGBoost does a great job as we will see. Also, XGBoost can use multiple features instead of just the electricity demand.\n\nI was inspired to use XGBoost for time series forecasting after seeing a couple of Youtube videos ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV12dGe_Fho&t=3s) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ZnOW-S550&t=800s)) from [Rob Mulla](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube).\n\n### Simple XGBoost model\nThe first XGBoost model is a simple model for which some of the parameters are defined and the data is split into train and test sets. This model is fairly simple, but it's a great baseline\n\n#### Training - test split\nThe first step is to split the data. I will split the data into train, test and hold-out set. The hold-out set will be used for independent evaluation of the model while the model is being trained.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to use the cross validation class because it took too long to run. In case you're interested in that class, the API's example is as follows:\n\n`from prophet.diagnostics import cross_validation\ndf_cv = cross_validation(m, initial='730 days', period='180 days', horizon = '365 days')`\n\nIt's worth noting that the model needs to be fitted first and the `cross_validation` object can be used to compute the metrics from each fold.\n\nAlso, since each model takes long to be fitted (up to 2 miniutes), I chose only 2 splits, which isn't a recommended practice, especially given that this is a large dataset,  \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"n_years_test = 2\ntss_prophet = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=2, test_size=48 * 365 * n_years_test, gap=48)\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(15, 10), sharex=True)\n\nfold = 0\nfor train_index, test_index in tss_prophet.split(df[df.index<threshold_date_1]):\n    train_data = y_train.to_frame() \\\n                        .reset_index() \\\n                        .iloc[train_index] \\\n                        .rename(columns={\"settlement_date\": \"ds\", \"tsd\": \"y\"})\n\n    test_data = y_train.to_frame() \\\n                    .reset_index() \\\n                    .iloc[test_index] \\\n                    .rename(columns={\"settlement_date\": \"ds\", \"tsd\": \"y\"})\n    \n    axes[fold].plot(train_data[\"ds\"], train_data[\"y\"], label=\"Training set\")\n    axes[fold].plot(test_data[\"ds\"], test_data[\"y\"], label=\"Test set\")\n    axes[fold].axvline(test_data[\"ds\"].min(), color=\"k\", ls=\"--\")\n    axes[fold].legend(loc=\"center\", bbox_to_anchor=(1.075, 0.5))\n\n    axes[fold].set_title(\"Prediction on test set -

A simple XGBoost model and a single train-test split results in a MAPE value of 9.2%. Surely the model needs more work and tuning, but a couple of lines of code gave me a very accurate prediction I couldn't get that accuracy level with SARIMA after spending hours tweaking the parameters. \n\nWhile a single train-test split isn't the optimal way to train a model, the combination of cross-validation and grid search with a hold-out set for independent evaluation is the right way to do things. This option yields an error of 7.3%, which is a great value since I only tuned a few hyperparameters.\n\n**Linear Boosting** has proven to be a great alternative to Gradient Boosted Trees for time-series forecasting and it addresses the main problems that GBT have. This model has a great potential, but it's slow tp run. Unfortunately, it cannot be sped up using GPUs and multi-core CPU is the only way to speed up the computations. \n\n**Prophet** has also proven why it's one of the go-to options for time-series forecasting. The performance is slightly worse than XGBoost, but I barely tuned the hyperparamters. The only downside from this model is the execution time as it takes on average 3 minutes to train a model. As a result, a simple cross validation (2 folds) and grid search (only two combinations) results in 12 minutes.  \n\n**LSTM** recurrent networks show a great performance and the ability to use GPUs to speed up the training makes them a very atractive option. I'm glad I didn't jump stratight into this approach, which has become the go-to approach for time-series forecasting, but it has proven why it's such a great choice.\n\nWith regards to the **SARIMA** models, they can't capture the complexity of the time series. I soon realised I couldn't use the data set with two measurements per hour. I had to resample it using a daily frequency, which isn't ideal for this problem. However, I tried to optimised the parameters to capture the yearly trend and make a reasonable prediction, but I didn't managed. I don't know if I should a different strategy to tune the parameters or the model simply isn't suitable to this application. \n\nIn previous notebooks versions, I recommended XGBoost for this prediction task given the accuracy and runtime. However, as I learn more about time-series forecasting and the problems Gradient Boosting Trees have, I'm more hesitant when it comes to choosing XGBoost for this task. Although I would like to explore Prophet and Linear Boosting more before making a recommendation.
